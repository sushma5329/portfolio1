            <h1>NETWORKING BASED : RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN NETWORK TRAFFIC USING HTML</h1>
            <image src="networking.jpg"></image>
            <p>Role : Data gathering,working on models and analyzing results</p>
            <p>Description : The project aims to leverage Distributed Machine Learning to revolutionize resource
                allocation in network traffic. By dynamically analyzing and predicting network demands, it seeks to
                optimize resource usage, enhance user experience, and provide a scalable solution for future networking
                challenges. This approach not only improves operational efficiency but also sets the stage for more
                advanced, intelligent network management systems
            <p>Applications : Telecommunications, Cloud Computing, Smart Cities</p>
